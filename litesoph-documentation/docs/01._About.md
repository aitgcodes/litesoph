# About

Here we will add the basic knowledge about Litesoph software


The LITESOPH project is dedicated to crafting a versatile toolkit tailored for the rigorous exploration of photo-induced phenomena through Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) calculations, all within a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) accessible via our website. Our primary objective is to empower computational researchers with the means to conduct, oversee, and analyze large-scale simulations in a high-performance computing (HPC) environment effortlessly.

Designed with the specific needs of computational researchers in mind, our toolkit caters to a broad spectrum of applications, including but not limited to solar energy conversion endeavors such as photovoltaics, water-splitting catalysts, and solar fuels. Additionally, it facilitates research in opto-electronic materials, photochemistry, and photobiology, offering a comprehensive solution for diverse scientific inquiries.

At the core of LITESOPH lies a meticulously crafted ensemble of Python-based layers seamlessly integrated with popular and open-source TDDFT codes, including OCTOPUS, GPAW, and NWChem. This synergy ensures not only robust performance but also accessibility and flexibility, empowering researchers to delve into the intricacies of photo-induced processes with unparalleled ease and efficiency
